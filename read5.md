## CSS allows you to create rules that control the
way that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.

## CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
href
This specifies the path to the
CSS file (which is often placed in
a folder called css or styles).
type
<h3; color:red>
This attribute specifies the type
of document being linked to. The
value should be text/css.
rel
This specifies the relationship
between the HTML page and
the file it is linked to. The value
should be stylesheet when
linking to a CSS file. </h3>


**rgb values**
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)
 hex codes
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80
color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:

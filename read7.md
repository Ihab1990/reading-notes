#A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

#To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 

1: DEFINE THE GOAL
2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
3: CODE EACH STEP

Vocabulary: The words that computers
understand
â€¢ Syntax: How you put those words together to
create instructions computers can follow

Computers solve problems programmatically; they
follow series of instructions, one after another. The
type of instructions they need are often different to
the type of instructions you might give to another
human. Therefore, throughout the book you will not
only learn the vocabulary and syntax that JavaScript
uses, but you will also learn how to write instructions
that computers can follow. 

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions. 
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
